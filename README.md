## 📖 Project Purpose

This timeline chronicles the public retaliation campaign faced by whistleblower Yu Chao after he disclosed abuse and misconduct related to the Shen Yun performing arts company and Falun Gong leadership.

It provides a transparent, evidence-based view of the sequence of public statements, media narratives, legal actions, and threats that have unfolded. The purpose is to assist legal counsel, journalists, and concerned observers in understanding the documented pattern of escalating retaliation.

The project is an independent volunteer effort presented in good faith and with careful attribution to original sources.

## 📌 Methodology

**Sources**: Only verifiable public statements, published articles, or publicly available videos are included.

**Attribution**: Where a claim comes from a Falun Gong-affiliated source (e.g., *Minghui.org*, *Epoch Times*), this is clearly stated. No independent verification is implied unless noted.

**Neutrality**: The timeline presents a chronological sequence of facts, not an argument. Readers may form their own conclusions based on the documented pattern.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

All entries reflect publicly available materials. Statements quoted from Falun Gong-affiliated sources or other actors represent those parties' public statements. No private materials or unverified allegations are included.

This project aims to inform public understanding and support transparency around whistleblower retaliation patterns. It is not intended to defame, nor to misattribute, nor to overstate causality beyond what public documentation supports.

## 📌 Intended Use

- Provide a resource to potential legal counsel to understand the factual sequence.
- Support public understanding of a complex and under-reported case.
- Assist journalists in contextualizing the broader issues of internal repression within high-control groups.
- Serve as a reference point for future accountability efforts.
