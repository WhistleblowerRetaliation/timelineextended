## Why This Timeline Matters

This is not an ordinary online dispute. The materials document:

- structured, coordinated retaliation by organizational actors
- the use of ideological smears, spiritual vilification, and retaliatory law enforcement referrals
- escalation into real-world consequences including an FBI search and criminal charges
- weaponization of protected status to silence dissent within a high-control group

The case also raises urgent public-interest questions:

- Who protects individuals harmed within such organizations when protected status is used to shield abuse?
- How do we safeguard freedom of expression and whistleblower rights in such contexts?
- How do we prevent the misuse of ideological narratives to dehumanize critics (e.g., labeling someone a “negative being”)?

## Evidence Methodology

This project draws upon:

### Primary sources:

- original **Minghui.org** articles
- official **Falun Gong–affiliated English translations**
- **Yu Chao’s YouTube videos** documenting his disclosures and responses
- mainstream media coverage (e.g., **The New York Times** series)
- public legal filings (e.g., *Chang v. Shen Yun*, *Sun et al v. Shen Yun*)
- public references to related FBI / law enforcement actions

### Data collection:

- legally archived articles from original sources
- publication dates use the **Chinese original publication time**, as this was the first release and was directly countered by Yu Chao’s YouTube responses
- English translations are included as provided by the organizations themselves for accessibility and accuracy

### Screening methodology:

- use of **AI-assisted tools** to detect ideological language and possible coded targeting
- **manual expert review** based on ground truth labels and known Falun Gong symbolism

## Important Notes

- This project does not target religious belief. We affirm **freedom of religion** and respect individual faith.
- The focus is on **organizational conduct**: retaliation against dissent, spiritual vilification, and abuse of protected status.
- No person should be dehumanized or face reprisals for speaking out on matters of public concern.
