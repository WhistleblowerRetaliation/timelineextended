# Public Statement Regarding Retaliation Against Whistleblower Yu Chao

Yu Chao, a long-time Falun Gong practitioner, courageously came forward to report serious abuses occurring within affiliated organizations — including coercive labor practices, psychological harm, and systemic retaliation against dissenting voices.

Since making his disclosures public through YouTube videos, Yu Chao has faced an escalating campaign of retaliation. This includes:

- Online defamation and ideological smears through affiliated media outlets
- Spiritual vilification using coded language (e.g., labeling him a “negative being”) in religious publications
- Apparent retaliatory referrals to law enforcement, which triggered an FBI search
- Criminal charges arising from that search, despite no evidence of violent intent

This pattern of retaliation is not an isolated online dispute, but a structured and coordinated effort by organizational actors to silence a whistleblower and intimidate others from speaking out.

The case also highlights a troubling gap in legal and institutional protections: while the U.S. rightly defends Falun Gong members from persecution by the Chinese government, **who protects individuals harmed within such high-control groups when protected status is weaponized to shield internal abuses?** This question is urgent — for minors in Shen Yun, for dissenting members like Yu Chao, and for future whistleblowers.

It is equally important to state that this case is **not about religious belief**. We affirm the principle of religious freedom. The concern here is about conduct — the use of ideological labeling, spiritual vilification, and retaliatory actions to target and silence an individual exercising lawful free speech. No person should be dehumanized or subjected to reprisals merely for speaking out on matters of public concern.

The case raises important questions about the abuse of spiritual authority, the misuse of ideological narratives, and the deployment of legal processes to punish dissent. We call for fair legal process and for public attention to the chilling effects of such retaliation.
