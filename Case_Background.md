# Case Background

## Who is Yu Chao

Yu Chao is a long-time practitioner of Falun Gong. Starting around 2021, after becoming concerned about growing reports of internal abuses within affiliated organizations — particularly Shen Yun Performing Arts — he began publicly voicing his concerns and opinions.

His commentary escalated in 2022 to 2023, as more former Shen Yun performers and insiders privately confided in him, providing firsthand accounts of coercive labor practices, psychological harm, and systemic retaliation against dissenting voices.

Yu Chao chose to speak out through YouTube videos and public commentary, motivated by a belief in transparency, accountability, and the basic human dignity of those affected.

## Why This Timeline Matters

This timeline project documents the pattern of retaliation Yu Chao has faced since making his disclosures public — including:

- Coordinated ideological attacks in affiliated media
- Spiritual vilification using coded language (e.g. "negative being")
- Apparent retaliatory referrals to law enforcement
- Criminal charges resulting from this retaliatory process

This is not an isolated online dispute. It reflects a structured campaign targeting a whistleblower for protected speech.

The timeline also raises urgent questions about how protected status (as a persecuted religious group) may be misused to shield internal abuses — leaving dissenters and victims with no institutional recourse.

## Evidence Methodology

- The core evidence comes from public materials published by Minghui.org and other Falun Gong–affiliated outlets, as well as mainstream media reporting and Yu Chao’s public statements.
- All articles were legally crawled and archived for integrity verification.
- AI-assisted screening was used to identify articles employing ideological smears and coded references.
- A manual legal review was conducted to select high-relevance examples.
- The timeline uses the original Chinese publication date for articles, as this date represents when the content first reached practitioners and was first countered by Yu Chao’s videos.
- Where available, official English translations were included for transparency.

## Disclaimer

This project is an independent documentation effort.  
It reflects public information, documented evidence, and good-faith analysis.

It is not an anti-religious project and does not oppose religious freedom.  
The concern here is about **conduct**: the use of ideological narratives and legal harassment to punish dissent.

No person should face spiritual vilification, public smearing, or criminal retaliation merely for speaking out on matters of public concern.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q:** Is this project attacking Falun Gong as a belief?  
**A:** No. We affirm religious freedom. This project highlights harmful conduct occurring within certain affiliated organizations — conduct that is incompatible with basic human rights.

**Q:** Is Yu Chao a Chinese government agent?  
**A:** There is no evidence whatsoever to support such claims. Labeling whistleblowers as "CCP spies" is a common tactic used to silence dissent. Yu Chao’s record is entirely consistent with being a practitioner speaking from conscience.

**Q:** Why does this matter to the public?  
**A:** High-control groups operating under protected status should not be immune from scrutiny or accountability for internal abuses. This case raises urgent questions about how whistleblowers and victims within such groups can be protected.
